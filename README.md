### MVP - User Stories:
1. User can create profile with Outcomes "Materials" - Resume, Portfolio, links etc. (my Rails mini-project)
2. User will receive a push notification every day asking if the user has committed code to Github that day.
3. If the user says yes, the user would be asked to input the number of hours spent coding that day.
4. User can see a log of the number of hours spent each day, displayed over the course of a calendar month.

### Stretch Goal:
5. User can see stats over the course of a month in the form of bar charts generated with D3

### Next Stage:

6. User can log tracking information for a variety of "Outcomes" activities: job applications, networking events, etc.
